# Programmable Congestion Control on the BlueField-3 with DOCA PCC

In [Part I](tutorial-doca-flow.md) you programmed the NIC to *mark* congestion — you set the **CE**
bit on packets in the data plane. In this part you write the other side of that story: the
**congestion-control algorithm that reacts to those marks**, deciding how fast a flow is allowed to
send — and you run it on a set of tiny processors *inside* the NIC called the **DPA**.

By the end you will have **written the two reactions at the heart of a reaction-point controller**,
watched a flow's send rate **collapse** the moment congestion appears and **recover** when it clears,
and tuned how aggressively it reacts.

We build up in three parts:

- **Part A** — *where* the algorithm runs: the two halves (a host program that loads it, and the DPA
  that runs it), and how a "rate" is expressed.
- **Part B** — *how* the controller thinks: the event loop and the two reactions that make up a
  DCQCN-style loop — both of which you'll write.
- **Part C** — fill in the two reactions one at a time: **TODO 1** (the cut) and watch the rate
  collapse, then **TODO 2** (the recovery) and watch the sawtooth; then tune how hard it reacts.

> **Prerequisites.**
> - You have done [Part I](tutorial-doca-flow.md) — PCC reacts to the ECN marks you produced there.
> - You are on the **Arm cores** of a BlueField-3 with this repo checked out and `sudo` access.

## Part A — Where the algorithm runs

### Two halves: a host loader and a DPA program

A DOCA PCC program comes in two pieces that run in two different places:

```
        HOST — the Arm cores (control plane)            NIC hardware (data plane)
   ┌──────────────────────────────────┐        ┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │  doca_pcc_ecn_rp   (host program) │ loads  │   DPA cores run YOUR algorithm           │
   │   • opens the PCC context         │ ─────► │   your_algo()  runs once per EVENT       │
   │   • uploads the DPA program        │        │     ▲ events: a packet sent, a CNP, …    │
   │   • prints logs, stays running     │        │     ▼ writes results->rate               │
   └──────────────────────────────────┘        │   NIC per-flow RATE LIMITER ◄── set here  │
                                               └────────────────────────────────────────┘
```


- **The host program** ([`doca_pcc_ecn_rp`](doca-2/doca-pcc-ecn/host/pcc_ecn_rp.c)) is just a
  **loader and supervisor**. It uploads your compiled algorithm to the NIC, opens the PCC context,
  and then sits there keeping it alive and printing logs. It does **not** run the algorithm itself.
- **The algorithm** runs on the **DPA** — the *Data-Path Accelerator*, a cluster of small, highly
  parallel processors inside the BlueField-3. That is where the C code you'll look at actually
  executes.

> **INFO — what is the DPA, and why not the Arm cores?** The Arm cores are general-purpose Linux
> CPUs; they are too far from the wire to make a per-flow rate decision fast enough. The DPA sits
> right on the data path and is built for exactly this kind of tiny, frequent, reactive computation.
> You write the algorithm in C, a special compiler (`dpacc`) turns it into a DPA program, and the
> host loader ships it onto the NIC.

### The one thing your algorithm actually outputs: a rate

Your algorithm's whole job is to set **one number per flow**: a target send **rate**. It never
touches a packet and never paces anything itself. It writes the rate into a `results` struct, and
when it returns, the NIC programs that flow's **hardware rate limiter** to that value. From then on
the *hardware* paces the packets — at line speed, with your algorithm nowhere in the loop — until the
next event, when your code runs again to revise the number.

> **INFO — rate is a fraction, not a bits-per-second.** The rate is a fixed-point number where
> **`1 << 20` (= 1,048,576) means "100% of line rate."** So `524288` is 50%, and a small floor value
> is a near-stop. You will see constants like this in the code; just read `1 << 20` as "full speed."

This split is the key idea of PCC: **you write the *policy* (what the rate should be), the NIC
hardware does the *work* (pacing every packet).**

### Build it and run it once

You now know the two halves and what the algorithm outputs. Before we open the algorithm itself,
**build the whole thing and run it once** — to prove your toolchain works and to *see* the two halves
in action: the host loader compiling your DPA program, uploading it to the NIC, and running it live.

> **NOTE — the algorithm is deliberately incomplete right now.** The controller you're about to run
> is a **scaffold**: the two reactions that move the rate are left blank (you write them in Part C).
> So it loads, runs, and *sees* congestion — but it won't change the rate yet. That's expected; this
> step is about the plumbing, not the policy.

<details>
<summary><b>Try it yourself! — build the controller and watch it run</b></summary>

<br>

**Step 1 — build.** On the card's Arm cores, from the repo root:
```bash
cd doca-2 && meson setup build && ninja -C build
# => build/doca-pcc-ecn/doca_pcc_ecn_rp   (the host loader; the DPA program is compiled into it)
```
That one step compiles the C you'll edit in Part C into a **DPA image** and links it into the host
loader. It builds fine even with the two reactions still blank.

**Step 2 — load the controller** on PF1, in the **foreground**, so all its output prints right here
on the terminal:
```bash
sudo stdbuf -oL ./build/doca-pcc-ecn/doca_pcc_ecn_rp -d mlx5_1 -l 50
```
> **INFO — the flags.** `-d mlx5_1` picks PF1 (the sender's uplink — the "reaction point"); `-l 50`
> is a chatty log level; `stdbuf -oL` keeps the output line-buffered so it appears as it happens. It
> runs in the **foreground** — you watch it live and stop it with **Ctrl-C** (that sends SIGINT, the
> graceful stop; never `kill -9` it — see [Debugging Tips](#debugging-tips)).

It opens the PCC context, uploads your DPA program, and then waits for events. With no traffic yet it
just sits there — that's expected; a controller with nothing to react to has nothing to do.

**Step 3 — give it something to see.** In **other terminals** (leave the controller running), start
the Part I marker (so packets are CE-marked and the receiver sends CNPs), then drive traffic with
`benchmark.sh` — the loopback is already up from Part I:
```bash
# in a doca-2 terminal — the Part I marker: CE-mark every packet
sudo ./build/doca-flow/doca_flow_ecn_pcap -- --percent 100
# in another terminal (from the repo root) — runs server + client together, with a live throughput chart
./scripts/benchmark.sh
```

**What you should see.** Back in the controller's terminal: now that traffic is flowing, its own
`PURE_ECN` trace scrolls by — proof your algorithm is running on the DPA and seeing the CNPs:
```
PURE_ECN cnp=1    rate=1048576
PURE_ECN cnp=501  rate=1048576
PURE_ECN cnp=1001 rate=1048576     # it SEES the CNPs, but the rate never moves — no reactions yet
```
Those lines are mixed in with the loader's chatter; if it's too busy to read, stop it and reload with
`| grep --line-buffered PURE_ECN` appended to show only these. That flat rate is exactly the point of
the checkpoint: **your code compiled, loaded onto the NIC's DPA, and is running** — it just doesn't
*react* yet. Making it react is Part C. (`1048576` is `1 << 20` — full line rate, from the INFO box
above.)

**Step 4 — stop it.** In the controller's terminal press **Ctrl-C** (SIGINT — the graceful stop),
then stop the marker and traffic in the other terminals.

## Part B — How the controller reacts: a DCQCN loop

### Start at `main()`: how the controller gets loaded

You ran this program in Part A; here is what it actually does, top to bottom. This is the **host
half** — the loader and supervisor — and you won't edit it, but following its flow shows exactly
where *your* code (the DPA half) gets plugged in and takes over. It all lives in
[`host/pcc_ecn_rp.c`](doca-2/doca-pcc-ecn/host/pcc_ecn_rp.c):

1. **Read the two flags** — `-d <device>` (which NIC, e.g. `mlx5_1`) and `-l <level>` (log verbosity).
2. **Open that device** —
   [`open_pcc_device()`](doca-2/doca-pcc-ecn/host/pcc_ecn_rp.c#L103) finds the IB device with that
   name that *supports PCC*, and opens it.
3. **Create a PCC context** on the device — `doca_pcc_create()`.
4. **Attach your algorithm** —
   [`doca_pcc_set_app(pcc, pcc_ecn_rp_app)`](doca-2/doca-pcc-ecn/host/pcc_ecn_rp.c#L182). That
   `pcc_ecn_rp_app` is the **compiled DPA image**, built from `device/rp_main.c` + your
   `device/algo/rtt_template.c` — this single line is where the code you write gets loaded in.
5. **Configure it** — the DPA thread pool, the CNP probe format (plain RoCE CNP), logging/coredump.
6. **Start it** —
   [`doca_pcc_start(pcc)`](doca-2/doca-pcc-ecn/host/pcc_ecn_rp.c#L211) uploads your algorithm onto the
   NIC's DPA and sets it running. **From this moment the DPA is in charge:** every congestion event
   runs your code.
7. **Supervise** — the host then just loops in
   [`doca_pcc_wait()`](doca-2/doca-pcc-ecn/host/pcc_ecn_rp.c#L231), checking the process stays
   healthy and otherwise doing nothing. All the real per-event work is on the DPA now.

Steps 1–5 are setup, **step 6 is the handoff**, and step 7 is the host getting out of the way.
Everything from here on — the part you actually write — runs on the DPA, once per event. That is what
the rest of Part B is about.

### It runs once per event, per flow

The DPA calls your algorithm **once per congestion-relevant event, for each flow** — not once per
packet. The entry point is
[`doca_pcc_dev_user_algo()`](doca-2/doca-pcc-ecn/device/rp_main.c#L30); it hands your code that
flow's saved state, the event, and a `results` struct — you set the new rate by writing it into
`results` (the function itself returns nothing). The events that matter here are:

- a **packet was sent** (a "TX" event),
- a **CNP arrived** — a Congestion Notification Packet, the receiver's way of saying "I got a
  CE-marked packet, you are causing congestion" (this is the mark you set in Part I, echoed back).

> **INFO — the NIC batches events for you.** At line rate the DPA could never keep up with one event
> per packet, so the hardware **coalesces** them: one event stands for many packets. That is what
> keeps the algorithm fast enough — it reacts per *batch*, while the hardware rate limiter does the
> per-packet work.

### How an event reaches your handler

You don't wire any of this up. The DPA calls **one fixed entry point** per event, and a small
dispatch routes it to the right handler by **event type**. Here's the path a **CNP** takes to the
code you'll write (`TODO 1`), and where the other events land:

```
  a CNP arrives at the NIC   (the receiver echoing back your Part I CE mark)
                │
                ▼   NIC coalesces events, then calls your entry point — once, for this flow:
  doca_pcc_dev_user_algo(algo_ctxt, event, attr, results)                        ← rp_main.c
      │      algo_ctxt = this flow's saved state       results = where you write the new rate
      ▼
  rtt_template_algo(event, …)   reads the event's ev_type, then routes on it     ← rtt_template.c
      │
      ├─ ev_type == ROCE_TX   →  rtt_template_handle_roce_tx()    ← TODO 2 (raise the rate)
      ├─ ev_type == ROCE_CNP  →  rtt_template_handle_roce_cnp()   ← TODO 1 (cut the rate)  ★ this one
      └─ new flow / NACK / …  →  handled for you
                │
                ▼   your handler writes results->rate
  the NIC programs this flow's hardware rate limiter to that value
```


So each of the two reactions below is just the body of one of those `..._handle_roce_*` functions
— the dispatch that gets you there is already written.

### The two reactions

Our controller is a textbook **DCQCN** loop — the classic "additive-increase / multiplicative-
decrease" pattern. All of it lives in two short handlers in
[`rtt_template.c`](doca-2/doca-pcc-ecn/device/algo/rtt_template.c#L450), and each does one thing. **Both of
them are left blank for you** — that's the exercise — so below we describe exactly what each must do
and the pieces you build it from. You'll write them in Part C; here, just take in the shape.

**1. A CNP arrives → cut the rate (multiplicative decrease). ← you write this, `TODO 1`.**
Congestion is happening, so the rate must come **down** by a fixed factor, and never fall below a
floor. It goes in
[`..._handle_roce_cnp()`](doca-2/doca-pcc-ecn/device/algo/rtt_template.c#L375), at the marker `TODO 1`.
The pieces, all already there for you:
- `cur_rate` — the flow's current rate (the fixed-point number from Part A); you edit it in place.
- `ECN_CNP_DEC_FACTOR` — the cut factor, ×0.90 by default (a `#define` at the top of the file).
- `doca_pcc_dev_fxp_mult(factor, rate)` — multiplies that fixed-point `factor` into a rate for you.
- `MIN_RATE` — the floor the rate must not drop below.

**2. Packets keep flowing, no congestion → raise the rate (additive increase). ← you write this,
`TODO 2`.** When traffic is moving and nothing is cutting it, the rate should **drift back up** —
gently, and only occasionally, so it doesn't overshoot and immediately re-trigger congestion. It
goes in
[`..._handle_roce_tx()`](doca-2/doca-pcc-ecn/device/algo/rtt_template.c#L218), at the marker `TODO 2`.
The pieces:
- a `static` counter, so you act only every ~1000th call rather than on every single send event;
- `AI >> 2` — a small step to add each time, about 1.25% of line rate;
- `RATE_MAX` — the ceiling the rate must not exceed.

Those two reactions are the entire controller: it steers the rate on the ECN signal alone (the CNPs)
— which is what *pure-ECN* means. Put together, they make the DCQCN **sawtooth**: every CNP knocks
the rate down by 10%, and between CNPs
it drifts back up ~1.25% at a time. When the network is congested, the down-cuts win and the rate
settles low; when congestion clears (no more CNPs), the rate climbs back to full.

> **INFO — the one knob that changes its personality.** The decrease factor is a single constant at
> the top of the file,
> [`ECN_CNP_DEC_FACTOR`](doca-2/doca-pcc-ecn/device/algo/rtt_template.c#L54):
> ```c
> #define ECN_CNP_DEC_FACTOR (((1 << 16) * 900) / 1000)  // ×0.90 per CNP; 800..995 = ×0.80..×0.995
> ```
> `900` means ×0.90. Make it smaller and each CNP cuts harder; larger and it barely reacts. You'll
> use this constant in **TODO 1**, and tune it at the end of Part C.

---

## Part C — Write the two reactions, then watch it work

The controller is **almost complete**: the event loop, the logging, and the whole
host loader are done. **The two reactions that actually move the rate are left for you** — the ones
you studied in Part B:

- **`TODO 1`** — cut the rate when a CNP arrives (multiplicative decrease), in `..._handle_roce_cnp()`
- **`TODO 2`** — raise the rate when things are quiet (additive increase), in `..._handle_roce_tx()`

Both are marked in [`device/algo/rtt_template.c`](doca-2/doca-pcc-ecn/device/algo/rtt_template.c#L375). As
shipped they're empty, so the controller **builds and runs but never changes the rate** — a flow
sends flat-out no matter how congested the link is. You'll add them one at a time and watch each half
of the loop come alive.

The pieces you'll have running together while you test:

| what | where | why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| the ECN marker from Part I (`doca_flow_ecn_pcap`) | PF0 (`mlx5_0`) | marks packets CE, which makes the receiver send CNPs |
| **the PCC controller** (`doca_pcc_ecn_rp`) | PF1 (`mlx5_1`) | reacts to those CNPs by setting the sender's rate |
| RoCE traffic (`ib_write_bw`) | the SFs (`mlx5_2`/`mlx5_3`) | the flow whose rate you'll watch move |

### Stage 1 — write `TODO 1` (the cut) and watch the rate collapse

In the [Part A checkpoint](#build-it-and-run-it-once) you saw the scaffold run and its rate stay
**flat** under a flood of CNPs — it sees congestion but never reacts. Now you write the reaction that
makes it react.

<details>
<summary><b>Try it yourself! — make the controller react to congestion</b></summary>

<br>

**Step 1 — get the flow running, and note the baseline.** Bring the same setup back up as in the
[Part A checkpoint](#build-it-and-run-it-once) — the Part I marker at `--percent 100` and
`./scripts/benchmark.sh` — and note the baseline throughput on its chart (~92 Gb/s, "full speed").
As you saw there, with `TODO 1` still empty the rate sits flat and the BW doesn't budge. Leave the
traffic and marker running while you edit.

**Step 2 — write `TODO 1`.** Open
[`device/algo/rtt_template.c`](doca-2/doca-pcc-ecn/device/algo/rtt_template.c#L375) and find `TODO 1` in
`..._handle_roce_cnp()`. Using the pieces from Part B — `doca_pcc_dev_fxp_mult()`,
`ECN_CNP_DEC_FACTOR`, `cur_rate`, `MIN_RATE` — make the rate come **down** by the cut factor on each
CNP, then clamp it up to the floor so it can't go below `MIN_RATE`. It's two lines. (Stuck? The
[Check your answer](#check-your-answer) block below has it.)

**Step 3 — rebuild, reload, and watch it collapse.** Rebuild, then load the controller again in the
foreground (the traffic and marker from Step 1 are still running):
```bash
ninja -C build
sudo stdbuf -oL ./build/doca-pcc-ecn/doca_pcc_ecn_rp -d mlx5_1 -l 50
```
> **NOTE — the DPA image is built at *configure* time.** If an edit doesn't seem to take effect, do a
> clean rebuild: `rm -rf build && meson setup build && ninja -C build`.

**Now you should see two things:**

1. **The throughput drops sharply.** With the controller cutting the rate on every CNP, the client's
   BW average falls well below your baseline (it at least halves, usually much more). *That is
   congestion control happening* — the sender is throttling itself.

2. **The rate walking down in the controller's terminal** — the multiplicative-decrease half of the
   loop, live (the `PURE_ECN cnp=… rate=…` lines, no longer flat):
   ```
   PURE_ECN cnp=1    rate=943718
   PURE_ECN cnp=501  rate=214380
   PURE_ECN cnp=1001 rate=52428
   ...
   ```

**Stop the controller** with **Ctrl-C** (SIGINT — the graceful stop) when you're done looking.

</details>

### Stage 2 — write `TODO 2` (the recovery) and complete the sawtooth

With only `TODO 1`, the rate can only ever fall: once CNPs cut it, it stays down even after congestion
clears. `TODO 2` adds the other half — the gentle climb back up — so the controller can *recover*.

<details>
<summary><b>Try it yourself! — let the rate come back</b></summary>

<br>

**Step 1 — write `TODO 2`.** Find `TODO 2` in `..._handle_roce_tx()`. Using the pieces from Part B —
a `static` counter, `AI >> 2`, `RATE_MAX` — every ~1000th call, add the small step to `cur_rate` and
cap it at `RATE_MAX`. Acting only every ~1000th call is what keeps the increase *gentle* — leave the
gate out and the rate rockets straight back up and re-triggers congestion.

**Step 2 — rebuild:** `ninja -C build`.

**Step 3 — run, and this time make congestion come and go.** Load the controller (foreground) and
traffic as in Stage 1, then, partway through, **stop the marker** in its terminal so the CNPs dry up
while the flow keeps running:
```bash
sudo pkill -INT -x doca_flow_ecn_pcap    # congestion clears; no more CNPs
```
Watch the controller's terminal: while the marker ran the rate was cut down (that's `TODO 1`); once
the CNPs stop, the rate **climbs back toward full** (that's `TODO 2`). That rise-and-fall is the
DCQCN **sawtooth** — both halves of your controller working together:
```
PURE_ECN cnp=1001 rate=52428      # cut down while marking
# ... marker stopped: no new PURE_ECN cuts, and TX events raise the rate back toward 1048576 ...
```

**Stop** with **Ctrl-C** (SIGINT — the graceful stop).

```

</details>

### Going further (optional) — tune how hard it cuts

Now that the loop works, change **how aggressively** it reacts. Every CNP currently cuts the rate by
10% (`ECN_CNP_DEC_FACTOR` = ×0.90). This one number sets the controller's whole personality: a
sharper cut empties the queue faster (fewer retransmissions, higher goodput, lower latency) up to a
point; too sharp and you under-use the link.

<details>
<summary><b>Try it yourself! — sweep the cut factor</b></summary>

<br>

Open [`device/algo/rtt_template.c`](doca-2/doca-pcc-ecn/device/algo/rtt_template.c#L54) and change the
`900` in `ECN_CNP_DEC_FACTOR` (near the top of the file). Try a gentler reaction first, rebuild, and
re-run Stage 1:
```c
#define ECN_CNP_DEC_FACTOR (((1 << 16) * 990) / 1000)  // ×0.99 — barely cuts per CNP
```
With ×0.99 the rate barely comes down, the queue stays deep, and you'll see **far more CNPs** in the
controller's `PURE_ECN` trace and lower goodput than at ×0.90. Now try a **sharper** cut
(`800` = ×0.80) and compare —
fewer CNPs, a shallower queue. The tuned sweet spot on our testbed was **×0.90**:

| per-CNP cut | goodput | CNPs | latency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ×0.99 | 68 Gb/s | many | high |
| **×0.90** | **88.5 Gb/s** | few | **low** |
| ×0.80 | 86.7 Gb/s | fewest | very low |

> **INFO — the surprising bit.** The rate *set-point* averaged about the same across all of these,
> yet goodput ranged from 68 to 88 Gb/s. Goodput is governed by **queue depth and retransmissions**,
> not the average rate — which is why a *sharper* cut (shallower queue, fewer drops) can *raise*
> goodput. The [`tune_ecn.py`](doca-2/doca-pcc-ecn/tune_ecn.py) script and
> [`doca_pcc_ecn_sweep.pdf`](doca-2/doca-pcc-ecn/doca_pcc_ecn_sweep.pdf) sweep this automatically.

Put `900` back when you're done to restore the tuned controller.

## What you built (and saw)

- The **two-halves** model: a host loader ships your algorithm onto the **DPA**, which runs it once
  per event and sets a per-flow **rate** that the NIC hardware then enforces.
- The two reactions **you wrote** — `TODO 1` (CNP → cut ×0.90) and `TODO 2` (TX → raise ~1.25%) —
  which together make a complete **DCQCN** sawtooth.
- **Congestion control happening live**: with only the cut written, a flow's throughput collapsing as
  the controller reacts to the CE marks you produced in Part I; with the recovery added too, the rate
  climbing back when congestion clears.
- How **one constant** changes the whole behaviour, and why a sharper cut can *improve* goodput.

---

## Debugging Tips

- **The rate never moves — `PURE_ECN` prints the same number on every line** → `TODO 1` is still
  empty (or you edited it but didn't rebuild). That flat output is the scaffold's as-shipped
  behaviour; write the multiplicative decrease in `..._handle_roce_cnp()` and rebuild. If instead the
  rate falls but never climbs back after congestion clears, `TODO 2` (the increase, in
  `..._handle_roce_tx()`) is the missing half.
- **The controller exits a second or two after starting** → the firmware knob `USER_PROGRAMMABLE_CC`
  is not live. Check with `admin/local_scripts/check_pcc_ready.sh` (it should say `ready`). On the
  tutorial cards it's set for you; if you see `doca_pcc … not supported`, that's the cause.
- **No `PURE_ECN` lines ever appear** → no CNPs are reaching the controller. Make sure the Part I
  marker (`doca_flow_ecn_pcap --percent 100`) is running so packets are CE-marked, and that traffic
  is actually flowing. (If the controller's output is just too chatty to spot them, reload it with
  `| grep --line-buffered PURE_ECN` appended to see only that trace.)
- **Stop it gracefully with Ctrl-C** in its terminal (SIGINT) — or `sudo pkill -INT -x doca_pcc_ecn_rp`
  from another terminal. A hard `kill -9` (or `docker rm -f`) leaves a "ghost" program loaded on the
  DPA that blocks the next run until a chip reset.
- **Run it in the foreground** (as shown), so its output prints live on the terminal. Launched in the
  background over SSH it can appear to die after a few seconds — that's the launch, not the program;
  the foreground keeps it attached and visible.
- **An edit to the algorithm didn't take effect** → the DPA image is built at *configure* time, so do
  a clean rebuild: `rm -rf build && meson setup build && ninja -C build`.
- **Traffic must use `-R`** (`benchmark.sh` and `run_{server,client}.sh` already do). Without it, the flow isn't
  bound to your algorithm and your handlers never run — the rate won't move at all.

## FAQs

**What is `USER_PROGRAMMABLE_CC` and why is it needed?**
It's a NIC firmware setting that enables running your *own* congestion-control code on the DPA.
Without it, `doca_pcc_ecn_rp` refuses to start. It only goes live after a full power-cycle of the
card, so it's set up for you ahead of the tutorial.

**Why does the controller attach to `mlx5_1` (PF1), but traffic uses `mlx5_2`/`mlx5_3` (the SFs)?**
Congestion control is a property of the *port/uplink*, so the controller attaches to the sender's
physical function (PF1). The traffic rides on sub-functions of that port. One controller governs the
flows on its port.

**Why does the rate collapse so much at `--percent 100`?**
Because you're marking *every* packet, the receiver sends a constant stream of CNPs, so the
controller thinks the network is maximally congested and keeps cutting. Mark a smaller fraction
(`--percent 50`) for a gentler, more realistic signal.

**Does my algorithm run for every packet? Is the DPA fast enough?**
No — the NIC **coalesces** events, so your code runs per *batch*, far below the packet rate, and the
hardware rate limiter does the per-packet pacing. That two-tier split is exactly why it keeps up at
line rate.

**Why is the rate register not the same as the goodput I measure?**
The rate is a *set-point*; the throughput you get also depends on queueing and retransmissions. A
controller can hold a similar average rate yet deliver very different goodput — which is what the
Stage 2 sweep shows.

That's the pair: in **Part I** you marked the congestion signal in the data plane, and here in
**Part II** you wrote and tuned the controller that reacts to it on the DPA — the two halves of
programmable transport on a SmartNIC.
